# Weather App üå§Ô∏è

## Overview

This Weather App allows users to check the current weather of any city around the world. It fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and displays information like temperature, humidity, and weather condition.

## Functionality

- **Search Weather by City**: Users can input the name of a city and get the current weather conditions for that city.
- **Temperature**: Displays the temperature in Celsius.
- **Humidity**: Shows the humidity percentage of the selected city.
- **Weather Condition**: Displays a brief description of the weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, etc.).
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the city is not found or if there‚Äôs an issue with the API call.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The frontend framework used to build the app.
- **OpenWeather API**: Provides real-time weather data.
- **Axios**: Used to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeather API.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Fetches live weather data from OpenWeather.
- **Debounce Search**: To prevent excessive API calls, the search input is debounced, which delays the API call until the user stops typing.
- **Modern Design**: Stylish, modern UI with responsive design for various screen sizes.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages when an invalid city is entered.

  /src
    /components
      WeatherApp.js          // The main component with logic
    App.js                   // The root component
    index.js                 // The entry point of the React app

## Notes

- The app uses OpenWeather's free API, so there might be some rate-limiting if there are too many requests in a short period.
- Feel free to enhance the app by adding more features, like a 5-day forecast, different units for temperature, or a background change based on weather conditions.
